# A more detailed exploration of MPs' attendance and speaking count

This is a report inspired by the Kopi.co (https://thekopi.co/about/)'s report on Singapore's Members of Parliament, titled "How Active Are Your MPs in Parliament? Exploring MPsâ€™ Attendance and Speaking Count". Kopi's report included two tables containing the count of attendance and speaking during parliament sitting for all MPs.

However, the original table presented by the Kopi is a bit hard to comprehend. Therefore, I have done some exploration based on the data provided by the Kopi.

I have not verified if the attendance and speaking counts are correct. I did however, found that one of the MPs profile was wrongly recorded.
Assuming all counts are accurate, we might still underestimate the average performance of PAP here. The current cabinet members (including PM Lee) did not record any speaking counts. But I'm unsure of the reasons.
