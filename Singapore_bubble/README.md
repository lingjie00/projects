# Singapore_bubble
Looking at the travel bubble for Singapore, inspired by the Economist's "A good kind of bubble" (14 May)

I was reading the Economist's article "Could travel bubbles offer a route to economic recovery?" and get curious which country will be beneficial for Singapore to form travel bubbles with.
The article describes a potential selective travel agreement during COVID-19 pandemic. On the one hand, allowing travel between trading partners enable business activities to continue. On the other, increasing travel also increases the possibility of imported cases. One possible solution will be selective in countries to open borders with.
The article also says that it is more likely for countries to open borders with countries who are handling the COVID-19 situation equally well, if not better.
I tried to get a sense of Singapore's potential travel partners by comparing the active COVID-19 cases and trade volumes between Singapore and Singapore's trading partners. It seems like most of our potential partners will be in Asia.
