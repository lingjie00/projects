# Driving sales through ML
Targeted advertisement through ML

Businesses are profit driven, they aim to increase their revenue while keeping the cost low. One of the tools businesses employed to drive their revenue is marketing. However, marketing is expensive. In fact, Singapore’s marketing expenditure on digital marketing alone is projected to reach US$760m in 2020 (statista, 2020).

Marketing spending does not always translate to profit, if a company wrongly designed a marketing campaign, perhaps by targeting the wrong target audience, the company might suffer loss instead. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the right customer for marketing.

In this project, we aim to increase the sucess rate for an audiobook company’s marketing campaign by predicting the customers who are most likely to purchase an audiobook again.

We will be working with a dataset containing past user usage records, and we will be predicting the customer who will purchase another audiobook in 6 months time.

We are interested in maximising the potential user growth while minimising cost. Since F1-score measures the trade off between precision and recall, we will use F1-score as our business metrics. We will also set recall 3 times more important as precision to maximise the potential user growth while keeping cost at a reasonable level.

We will be solving this problem using a neural network model.
