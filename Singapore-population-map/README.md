# Singapore population map

Recently population growth is on trend again. I was curious how have our population figures change over the years. To quench my curiosity, I plot the Singapore population data by different planning areas in Singapore.

I used Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)'s planning area boundary to divide Singapore into different regions.\
I used two different datasets from data.gov.sg and singstat. One contains HDB population data while the other contains all the Singapore resident figures.

I used plotly choropleth maps to have a visual and interactive understanding of the changes in population.

From the data we see that the population growth trend has been pretty consistent without any major changes.\
We are not sure if we will reach 10 million population one day but certainly this will not happen in the near future.\
There are some interesting observations in this data, some of the area experience a steady population growth while other areas might either see rapid growth or decrease in population.\
The data we have is limited in explaining the observations, but we propose that BTOs might be one of the reason for the spike increase.
