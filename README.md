# Projects

This repo contains the small projects I have
created when I first started learning data
science. The projects include machine learning
model training with Kaggle datasets, competitions
I have participated and other random stuff.

This repo is outdated and messy, but might be
interesting to juniors who are intended to start
their own projects/ competitions.

If time allows, I might update the projects to
clean up the code structure and create
documentation.
