# Order Brushing
Detecting abnormal user behaviour, Shopee Code League 2020

People think of creative way to cheat the system.

For e-commerce sellers, one possible way is to create fake accounts to boost their rankings and reviews. We had previously solved this using network analysis.

Order brushing is another method sellers used. Some buyers employ third party to create fake purchases and post fake reviews, others simply use strangersâ€™ identifications. Since there might not be a clear relationship between sellers and buyers, relationship investigation between buyers and sellers become redundant.

This year, we will attempt to investigate fake orders without assuming relationship between buyer and seller and rely only on the transaction details.
